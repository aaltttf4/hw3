I found this project to be very interesting and insightful. The lack of user input is very different from other games. I learned a lot about state machines and how to use them, even though for my reproduction state, it never worked. I had to resort to using a spawner. I legit had no idea why it won't go into or out of mating state and that literally drove me crazy for hours trying to figure it out. My game is still very janky, and I wish my code organization was better. I was most proud of the sprites. I wanted to go with a chinese ink painting/deciduous forest theme, with different layers. I wanted there to be a bird that only stayed in the top layer, an animal that stayed in the middle, and one that was at the bottom. The snake and the mice kind of stay on the same level though.
